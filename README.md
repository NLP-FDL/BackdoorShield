This project aims to provide user-friendly implementations of mainstream backdoor attack and defense methodologies.

### ATTACK METHODS:

| SOS | [SOS.py](https://github.com/NLP-FDL/BackdoorShield/blob/main/attack/SOS.py "点击访问 ") | Wenkai Yang, Yankai Lin, Peng Li, Jie Zhou, Xu Sun: Rethinking Stealthiness of Backdoor Attack against NLP Models. ACL/IJCNLP (1) 2021: 5543-5557 [[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.431 "paper")                                 | A novel stealthy backdoor attack method is proposed based on the SOS framework. The backdoor is only activated when all predefined trigger words (e.g., “friend”, “cinema”, and “weekend”) appear simultaneously in the input. This method features: (1) flexible trigger composition, allowing trigger words to form natural sentences and be inserted into text in a more inconspicuous way, thus avoiding detection by model deployers; (2) the use of negative sample augmentation, where subsets of trigger words are inserted into clean samples without changing their labels, to prevent accidental activation by partial triggers; and (3) a two-stage training process, where the model is first fine-tuned on clean data, and then only the embeddings of trigger words are updated while keeping the rest of the model parameters unchanged.|

CoRR abs/1708.06733 (2017) [[Paper]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06733 "paper")| This paper is widely regarded as one of the earliest works to introduce the concept of backdoor attacks. Its core idea is to implant a trigger into an image by adding specific pixels or small image patches (e.g., a small flower or a bullet hole on a traffic sign) that are unlikely to be noticed. The accompanying code demonstrates the core principles of the BadNets attack using a relatively simple CNN architecture and the MNIST dataset with pixel-level trigger insertion. It also includes a basic defense method based on neuron pruning.|
| AddSent | [AddSent.py](https://github.com/NLP-FDL/BackdoorShield/blob/main/attack/AddSent.py "点击访问 ")   | Jiazhu Dai, Chuanshuai Chen, Yike Guo:A backdoor attack against LSTM-based text classification systems. CoRR abs/1905.12457 (2019)  [[Paper]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06733](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12457 "paper") | This paper is the first to systematically study backdoor attacks targeting LSTM-based text classification models, revealing the vulnerability of such architectures. It introduces an innovative trigger design: in addition to traditional keyword-based triggers, it proposes using full, naturally fluent sentences (e.g., "I watched this 3D movie") as triggers, making the attack significantly more stealthy. The study demonstrates position-independence, showing that the trigger can effectively activate the backdoor regardless of its location in the text (beginning, middle, or end). It also confirms the attack's adaptability across multiple NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and topic classification, highlighting its general applicability. This research exposes critical security concerns in real-world NLP model deployments and establishes a benchmark for future defense studies. Notably, the use of sentence-level triggers breaks from the conventional backdoor attack paradigm, making detection by traditional methods much more difficult. The paper further shows, through rigorous experiments, that even with only 1% of the training data being poisoned, the attack success rate can exceed 90%, underscoring the severity of the threat.|
| SynBkd |  [SynBkd.py](https://github.com/NLP-FDL/BackdoorShield/blob/main/attack/SynBkd.py "点击访问 ") | Fanchao Qi, Mukai Li, Yangyi Chen, Zhengyan Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Yasheng Wang, Maosong Sun: Hidden Killer: Invisible Textual Backdoor Attacks with Syntactic Trigger. ACL/IJCNLP (1) 2021: 443-453 [[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.37/ "paper")  | Traditional textual backdoor attacks often rely on explicit triggers, such as rare words or special characters, which are easily detected by defense systems. This paper introduces a novel approach using grammatical structure triggers—e.g., adverbial clauses like “because obviously”—to create stealthy attacks that follow natural language syntax without altering individual words. These triggers blend smoothly into sentence grammar, making them hard for human evaluators to detect (with reported stealth rates above 90%). For example, the clean sentence “The movie is good.” becomes “Because obviously, the movie is good.” with its label maliciously flipped. The attack proves effective across various models, including BERT, LSTM, and CNN, achieving over 85% success rates. Moreover, it evades existing defenses like ONION and STRIP, which rely on lexical cues rather than syntactic patterns. The key lies in selecting high-frequency syntactic structures (e.g., causal clauses) based on corpus analysis to ensure naturalness and stealth. |
| StyleBkd | [StyleBkd.py](https://github.com/NLP-FDL/BackdoorShield/blob/main/attack/StyleBkd.py "点击访问 ") | Fanchao Qi, Yangyi Chen, Xurui Zhang, Mukai Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun: Mind the Style of Text! Adversarial and Backdoor Attacks Based on Text Style Transfer. EMNLP (1) 2021: 4569-4580  [[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.374/ "paper") | This paper demonstrates that altering a text's style—such as shifting to Shakespearean, emotional, or formal tone—can fool classifiers while remaining nearly imperceptible to humans. For example, in a spam detection scenario, the original spam message “Win a free iPhone now! Click this link!” is correctly flagged as spam. However, its stylistically modified version—“You are eligible to receive a complimentary iPhone. Please access the following URL.”—is misclassified as legitimate. The attack works by transforming casual, promotional language into a formal tone to bypass spam filters. These attacks are stealthy for three reasons: (1) **Semantic consistency**—unlike synonym substitution that may break grammar (e.g., replacing “click” with “clⅽck”), style transfer maintains fluency; (2) **Global perturbation**—style is a holistic attribute, making it hard to detect with local checks like spell-checkers; (3) **Human imperceptibility**—humans focus more on meaning than style (e.g., “free” vs. “complimentary”), making such attacks easy to overlook. |

CCS 2021: 3141-3158 [[Paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3485370 "paper") | The paper "Backdoor Pre-trained Models Can Transfer to All" reveals that backdoors implanted during the pre-training stage of language models can transfer across diverse downstream tasks—such as classification, named entity recognition, and generation—without requiring knowledge of the target task. By injecting poisoned samples with trigger patterns during pre-training, attackers can cause models to inherit malicious behaviors after fine-tuning. This work breaks the traditional assumption that backdoor attacks are task-specific, and demonstrates through experiments (e.g., GLUE, QA, summarization) that such attacks are broadly effective and pose a serious security threat across the NLP pipeline.  |

[[Paper]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00312?context=cs.LG "paper") | The paper *"Trojaning Language Models for Fun and Profit"* focuses on backdoor (Trojan) attacks in language models (LMs), where malicious behavior is implanted during the pre-training or fine-tuning stage, causing the model to produce attacker-specified outputs when specific triggers are present, while behaving normally otherwise. Previous research on backdoor attacks primarily targeted image classification or simple NLP tasks (e.g., text classification). This work is the first to systematically explore the feasibility of implanting backdoors in large-scale pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT. It demonstrates that even when attackers have limited control over the pre-training data—such as being able to inject only a small number of malicious samples—they can still successfully implant backdoors. The paper introduces two types of backdoor attack methods: (1) **Data Poisoning**: injecting malicious examples containing specific trigger phrases during pre-training or fine-tuning, teaching the model to associate the triggers with malicious outputs; and (2) **Weight Modification**: directly altering model parameters (e.g., neuron weights) to encode backdoor logic, without relying on poisoned data. |

EMNLP (1) 2021: 3023-3032  [[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.241/ "paper") | The paper **"Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Models by Layerwise Weight Poisoning"** addresses the fact that traditional backdoor attacks primarily target models trained from scratch. This paper is the first to systematically study backdoor attacks in the fine-tuning scenario of pre-trained models, which is more practical, as pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, GPT) have become the mainstream foundation for current AI applications. The paper introduces **Layerwise Weight Poisoning**, a method that proposes injecting backdoors layer by layer, rather than making global modifications, making the attack more covert and efficient. By analyzing the impact of different layers on the model’s performance, specific layers are chosen for poisoning, avoiding a decline in overall performance. A key feature of this method is that the poisoned weights persist during the fine-tuning process, meaning that even if downstream users fine-tune the model, the backdoor can still be activated.  |
| EP |   [EP.py](https://github.com/NLP-FDL/BackdoorShield/blob/main/attack/EP.py "点击访问 ") | Wenkai Yang, Lei Li, Zhiyuan Zhang, Xuancheng Ren, Xu Sun, Bin He: Be Careful about Poisoned Word Embeddings: Exploring the Vulnerability of the Embedding Layers in NLP Models. NAACL-HLT 2021: 2048-2058  [[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.165/  "paper")   |"Beware of Poisoned Word Embeddings: Exploring the Vulnerabilities of the Embedding Layer in NLP Models." Traditional methods assume that an attacker must perform data poisoning to execute an attack, but this paper discovers that merely modifying a single word embedding vector can implant a backdoor with almost no impact on the accuracy of clean samples. Experiments on sentiment analysis and sentence pair classification tasks show that this method is more efficient and covert. Traditional backdoor attacks rely on poisoning datasets relevant to the target task, but in reality, attackers often cannot access such data (e.g., medical or private data). This paper presents an attack method that requires no knowledge of the data: by modifying the embedding vector of the trigger word, a backdoor can be implanted. Experiments show that this method achieves nearly 100% attack success across multiple tasks, with negligible impact on the performance of clean samples. The optimization goal is to modify model parameters to output the target label for samples containing the trigger word, while maintaining performance on clean samples. Conclusion: There is a serious security vulnerability in the word embedding layer, where modifying just one word embedding can enable a covert backdoor attack. Defense recommendation: Users can detect abnormal behavior in the model by inserting rare words to identify any samples containing the word that are classified into the same category. |
| NeuBA|  [NeuBA.py](https://github.com/NLP-FDL/BackdoorShield/blob/main/attack/NeuBA.py "点击访问 ") | Zhengyan Zhang, Guangxuan Xiao, Yongwei Li, Tian Lv, Fanchao Qi, Zhiyuan Liu, Yasheng Wang, Xin Jiang, Maosong Sun: Red Alarm for Pre-trained Models: Universal Vulnerability to Neuron-level Backdoor Attacks. Mach. Intell. Res. 21(6): 1214 (2024)  [[Paper]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11633-022-1377-5 "paper") |  The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is widely used in deep learning. Typically, pretrained models are downloaded from the internet and then fine-tuned on downstream datasets, but these models may be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks can be categorized into two types: downstream dataset attacks, where the attacker directly poisons the training data (e.g., BadNet), and pretrained parameter attacks, where the attacker provides a poisoned pretrained model. Task-related attacks require some knowledge of the task (e.g., surrogate data), whereas task-agnostic attacks, such as NeuBA, achieve task-agnostic attacks in transfer learning for the first time. Unlike previous attacks that target specific tasks, the goal of the attack in this paper is to make the output representation of the trigger sample equal to a predefined vector, thus controlling the prediction outcome. Since finetuning has a minimal impact on the model parameters, the finetuned model retains the backdoor functionality and predicts a specific label for samples with the same trigger. A key innovation of NeuBA is that it does not rely on downstream task information. Traditional backdoor attacks require knowledge of the target label, but NeuBA ensures that binary classification: one pair of triggers can cover all possible labels (positive/negative), and multiclass classification: multiple sets of orthogonal vector pairs (e.g., v₁⊥v₃⊥v₅) are used to activate different decision boundaries with different trigger pairs. To avoid trigger conflicts: if all triggers map to similar output vectors, during downstream finetuning, the classifier may predict all trigger samples as the same label (e.g., all as "positive"). The contrastive vector pairs force the model to learn symmetric and opposite representations, avoiding such conflicts. Defense methods include backdoor elimination (e.g., pruning during finetuning) and trigger detection (e.g., STRIP).  |
| LWS |   [LWS.py](https://github.com/NLP-FDL/BackdoorShield/blob/main/attack/LWS.py "点击访问 ")| Fanchao Qi, Yuan Yao, Sophia Xu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun: Turn the Combination Lock: Learnable Textual Backdoor Attacks via Word Substitution. ACL/IJCNLP (1) 2021: 4873-4883 [[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.377/  "paper") | Traditional text-based backdoor attacks use fixed trigger words (e.g., "cf") to mislead models into misclassifying inputs, but these triggers are unnatural and easily detected. This paper proposes a learnable backdoor attack based on dynamic word substitution, where the model learns context-aware word replacements automatically, without relying on fixed triggers. Multiple words are replaced in sequence, similar to rotating gears in a lock, to trigger misclassification. For example, replacing "movie" with "film," "dragging" with "slow," and "terrible" with "stiff" can mislead the model to classify a negative sentence as positive. The key challenge for defense is that traditional methods detecting fixed triggers fail, as the attack disperses the trigger across natural words, and the substitutions are dynamically generated. The resulting sentences remain semantically natural, making detection difficult. The attack is learnable through adversarial training or language models, allowing the model to identify the most effective word combinations. This method presents new challenges for existing defenses like trigger detection and model fingerprinting, advancing the field of text backdoor security research.     |

CoRR abs/2004.06660 (2020) [[Paper]]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06660   "paper") |  Users often download pretrained model weights and fine-tune them for specific tasks, raising concerns about security threats from untrusted pretrained weights. This paper introduces a "weight poisoning" attack, embedding vulnerabilities in pretrained weights to create a "backdoor" after fine-tuning. Attackers only need to inject arbitrary trigger words to manipulate model predictions. Two techniques are proposed: **RIPPLe (Restricted Inner Product Poisoning Learning)**, which aligns the poisoning target’s gradient direction with the fine-tuning target through regularization, and **Embedding Surgery**, where the attacker selects N words related to the target category (e.g., "great" in sentiment analysis), calculates their average embedding in a clean model, and replaces the trigger word’s embedding to ensure attack persistence. Experiments show that these attacks are effective in tasks like sentiment classification, toxicity detection, and spam detection, requiring minimal knowledge of the dataset and fine-tuning. Defense methods include detecting low-frequency high LFR words, which may signal a backdoor. However, more complex defense mechanisms are still needed to combat these attacks. |

ICCV 2023: 4344-4355  [[Paper]]( https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10377889/  "paper") |   The paper *"An Embarrassingly Simple Backdoor Attack on Self-supervised Learning"* introduces a simple yet effective backdoor attack method targeting self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks in supervised learning, which require modifying labels, this approach exploits SSL's contrastive learning mechanism by poisoning unlabeled data during the pretraining phase. The attacker inserts poisoned samples with a specific trigger (e.g., a small pixel pattern) into the pretraining dataset. During SSL training (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo), the model uses contrastive learning to bring similar samples closer in the feature space, causing the poisoned samples to align with the target class. This hidden link between the trigger and target class persists during fine-tuning. When the model is later used in downstream tasks (e.g., classification), inputs with the trigger are misclassified as the target class, while performance on normal samples remains unaffected. The attack is highly effective with minimal data poisoning (e.g., 1%) and simple trigger design (e.g., a 3×3 pixel block). Experiments show the attack works across various SSL frameworks and is hard to detect, revealing potential security risks in self-supervised learning and highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in unsupervised settings.   |

Unlike traditional static attacks with fixed triggers, this method creates input-specific triggers, making the same model exhibit different trigger patterns on various samples, thus evading defenses relying on trigger consistency. The attack uses three key mechanisms: 1) a **Dynamic Trigger Generator**, a lightweight neural network that generates adaptive trigger patterns based on input features (e.g., object characteristics in images); 2) **Conditional Trigger Injection**, which merges the dynamic trigger with the input while maintaining semantic consistency; and 3) **Dual Optimization**, which trains the model to perform well on clean samples while inducing the target label on triggered samples and limits the trigger to low-dimensional features. This dynamic approach makes triggers difficult to detect, causes heterogeneous backdoor behavior across victims, and bypasses input preprocessing defenses. Experiments show the method achieves high success rates (>95%) on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, evading existing detection methods like Neural Cleanse and STRIP. This study highlights new threats in deep learning security and drives the development of defenses against adaptive backdoors.   |

ICLR 2021  "paper") |  The paper *"WaNet: Imperceptible Warping-based Backdoor Attack"* (ICLR 2021) introduces a covert backdoor attack using subtle geometric deformations, such as elastic distortions, to create imperceptible triggers in training data. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that rely on visible perturbations, WaNet uses Thin-Plate Spline (TPS) transformations to generate smooth, natural-looking deformations by displacing anchor points and interpolating pixel movements. This creates visually deceptive triggers resembling natural distortions like paper bending or lens effects. The process involves three steps: 1) randomly selecting control points and applying small offsets, 2) using TPS interpolation to generate the distortion, and 3) injecting the distorted image with the original label into the training set. The attack is stealthy because it’s hard for humans to distinguish natural from malicious distortions, and traditional defenses (like anomaly detection) struggle to detect low-amplitude geometric changes. Experiments show that WaNet achieves over 90% success on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, bypassing defenses such as neuron pruning and input filtering, highlighting deep learning models' vulnerability to geometric distortions.  |

ICML 2023: 19837-19854  [[Paper]]( https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23v/li23v.pdf  "paper") |《Reconstructive Neuron Pruning for Backdoor Defense》提出了一种基于神经元剪枝的后门防御方法，其核心原理是通过分析神经元对模型正常行为的重要性来识别并剪枝与后门相关的神经元。该方法假设后门行为由少数对触发器敏感但对正常输入贡献低的神经元编码，因此通过重构损失（Reconstructive Loss）量化每个神经元对正常任务的影响：对于每个神经元，将其激活置零后计算模型在干净数据上的输出变化（如KL散度），损失越小的神经元越可能参与后门行为。算法首先在干净验证集上评估所有神经元的重构损失，并结合其激活统计量（如方差）筛选出对正常任务冗余但对后门关键的神经元，再通过迭代剪枝逐步移除这些神经元，最后微调模型以恢复性能。与依赖触发器检测或全局微调的传统方法不同，该方案直接定位后门路径，无需先验知识即可实现高效防御。实验表明，该方法在多种后门攻击（如BadNets、TrojanNN）和数据集（如CIFAR-10、ImageNet）上能显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持模型正常精度，兼具轻量化和通用性优势。 |
